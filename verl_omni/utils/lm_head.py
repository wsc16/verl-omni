"""Load a teacher's unembedding matrix for hidden-state (nitrobrew) OPD.

The Nitrobrew loss reconstructs teacher logits on the actor as
``z_t = h @ W.T``, where ``h`` is the teacher's last-layer hidden states and
``W`` is the teacher unembedding.  ``W`` is read once from safetensors on the
driver (no full HF model) and pushed to actor ranks via
``set_teacher_unembeds``.

Qwen3-Omni keys are verified against the checkpooint layout (thinker is a
Qwen3-MoE, so the thinker text head is ``thinker.lm_head.weight`` and the
thinker text embeddings live under ``thinker.model.embed_tokens.weight``).
